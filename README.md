Live Version!! [Martastic.net](https://www.martastic.net/)

#Martastic Frontend

* React version 16.13.1
* Redux version 4.0.5 for state management

Styling:
* Semantic UI for comments and "About Me" section on the profile
* Material-UI for all forms, buttons, schedule and friend cards, and tooltips (to view user info on Single Pic pages)
* Custom CSS for everything else

Goes along with [Martastic Backend](https://github.com/dekadekadeka/martastic-backend). Please get both for the full experience.

###Why can I like pics and stations an unlimited amount of times? All I have to do is close the modal and I can like it again! That's a bug!!
No, it isn't! I want users to be able to show love to their favorite pics and stations an unlimited amount of times! 
Besides, unless you're a bot, you're gonna get tired of constantly spamming the like button.

We are also not a social media app whose users live or die by the amount of likes they get. It's just for fun.

###TODO:
* Remove Semantic UI components and only use Material-UI.
* Allow user to directly upload a picture rather than have it hosted somewhere else and put in the URL.
